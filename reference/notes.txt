** npm comes with node
** npm init                  to create .json file that stores information about all dependencies
** npm install pkgName       to install that package locally
** npm install -g pkgName    to install that package globally

** node comes with many modules including
   node core modules (path, fs, http, etc)
   3rd party modules/ pkgs installed via npm
   custom modules (which are files that have export in them)

To include modules use :

const path = require('path');
const myFile = require ('./myFile');

** you can also install dev dependencies (ones just for developement)
npm install --save-dev modulename
npm install -D modulename          // other way

// use docs https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v13.x/docs/api/path.html
